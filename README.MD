####> intro
The American Community Survey (ACS), the single largest survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau besides the Decennial Census, is designed to provide insight into various aspects of the American experience. The public summary files contain some 20,000+ estimates ranging from the breakdown of the language spoken to how long is the average commute is. It provides unprecendented insight into the changing face of the American landscape and is used by non-profits, corporations, and other government entities to further their missions. Below, the Commerce Data Service shows how to take advantage of this vast wealth of public data by merging it with Consumer Complaint Database and highlighting specific areas of need.

####> objective
Use various methods to merge, extract and reshape the bulk release of ACS 5-year estimates. Then taking those methods and applying it to a non-profit case study to reveal areas of interest.
